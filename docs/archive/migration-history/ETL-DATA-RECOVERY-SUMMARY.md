# MongoDB Data Recovery Summary

## What Happened

After investigating the database situation, here's what I found:

1. **PostgreSQL is empty** - The original PostgreSQL database has no tables or data
2. **MongoDB has demo data** - The main `campaigns` collection has only 5 demo campaigns
3. **Original data is in backup** - The `campaigns_backup` collection contains all 13,417 original campaigns
4. **All related data exists** - Line items (3,343), strategies (13,417), and other related data are intact

## Data Successfully Extracted

I've created an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and extracted all data to `/bravo-1/scripts/data-export/`:

- **13,417 campaigns** (19.61 MB) - Original campaign data from backup
- **3,343 line items** (3.85 MB) - Line item details
- **13,417 strategies** (3.26 MB) - Strategy mappings
- **56,020 media buys** (14.15 MB) - Media buy records
- **142,333 platform entities** (663.21 MB) - External platform data
- **9,796 accounts** (3.17 MB) - Account information
- Plus channels, tactics, teams, and other reference data

Total extracted data: ~707 MB

## ETL Scripts Created

I've created three ETL scripts in `/bravo-1/scripts/etl/`:

1. **extract-data.ts** - Extracts all MongoDB data to JSON files
2. **transform-data.ts** - Transforms data to new embedded structure
3. **load-data.ts** - Loads transformed data back to MongoDB

## How to Use the ETL Process

### Option 1: Restore Full Data Now
```bash
cd bravo-1/scripts

# Transform the backup data to new structure
bun run etl:transform

# Load it back to MongoDB (will backup current data first)
bun run etl:load
```

### Option 2: Store Data Securely
Since the data is ~707 MB (mostly platform entities), you have several options:

#### For Development/Demo (if data is non-sensitive):
```bash
# The data is already in data-export/
# You can add it to git if appropriate
git add bravo-1/scripts/data-export/
git commit -m "Add MongoDB data export for recovery"
```

#### For Production Data:
```bash
# Compress the data
cd bravo-1/scripts
tar -czf mongodb-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz data-export/

# Upload to secure storage (S3, GCS, etc.)
# Then create a download script for team members
```

## Quick Commands

From the `/bravo-1/scripts` directory:

```bash
# Run complete ETL
npm run etl

# Or run individual steps
npm run etl:extract    # Extract from MongoDB
npm run etl:transform  # Transform to new structure  
npm run etl:load       # Load back to MongoDB
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Recovery**: Run `npm run etl:transform` then `npm run etl:load` to restore all 13,417 campaigns
2. **Secure Storage**: Compress and store the `data-export` folder in your preferred secure location
3. **Team Access**: Create a documented process for team members to restore data
4. **Version Control**: Consider storing a small demo dataset in git for development

## Data Structure

The transformed data will have campaigns with embedded strategies and line items:
```javascript
{
  campaignNumber: "CN-XXXX",
  name: "Campaign Name",
  lineItems: [
    {
      name: "Line Item Name",
      unitType: "impressions",
      unitPrice: 5.00,
      estimatedUnits: 100000,
      mediaPlan: [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

This matches the expected MongoDB structure from your migration documentation.
