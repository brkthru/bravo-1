# Media Tool Versioning System Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Media Tool has a **partially implemented** version control system for tracking changes to campaigns, strategies, line items, and media plans. While the infrastructure is sophisticated and well-designed, it's currently not connected to the main application logic, making it effectively dormant.

## Current Versioning Architecture

### 1. Infrastructure Components

#### Collections

- **`changeEvents`** - Audit log of all changes
- **`versionSnapshots`** - Point-in-time document snapshots
- **`systemConfig`** - Stores the VersionControl helper class

#### Capabilities When Enabled

1. **Atomic Change Tracking**
   - Records field-level changes with old/new values
   - Tracks user, timestamp, and reason for change
   - Uses MongoDB transactions for consistency

2. **Version Snapshots**
   - Complete document state at each version
   - SHA-256 hash for integrity verification
   - Semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.0.1, etc.)

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Version tagging for milestones
   - Export tracking
   - User role attribution
   - Change reason recording
   - Path-based field tracking

### 2. How It Works (When Active)

```javascript
// Example change tracking
await versionControl.trackChange(
  'campaign',
  'campaign-123',
  [
    { path: 'budget.total', value: 75000 },
    { path: 'status', value: 'active' },
  ],
  'user-456',
  'Client approved budget increase'
);
```

This creates:

1. A change event recording what changed
2. A version snapshot of the entire document
3. Updates the document with new version info

### 3. Current Implementation Status

| Component               | Status           | Notes                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Version collections     | ✅ Created       | `changeEvents`, `versionSnapshots` exist   |
| Indexes                 | ✅ Created       | Optimized for queries                      |
| Helper functions        | ✅ Available     | Full VersionControl class in systemConfig  |
| Document version fields | ❌ Missing       | No `version` field on campaigns/strategies |
| API integration         | ❌ Missing       | Not called during updates                  |
| UI for version history  | ❌ Missing       | No frontend components                     |
| Rollback functionality  | ❌ Not connected | Code exists but not integrated             |

## Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Well-Architected**: Event sourcing + snapshots is a solid pattern
2. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Field-level changes with full attribution
3. **Transaction Safety**: Uses MongoDB transactions for consistency
4. **Flexible Tagging**: Supports milestones and export tracking
5. **Performance Optimized**: Proper indexes for efficient queries

### Critical Gaps

1. **Not Actually Running**
   - Version control code exists but isn't called
   - Documents don't have version fields
   - No automatic change tracking on updates

2. **No User Interface**
   - No way to view version history
   - No UI for comparing versions
   - No rollback interface

3. **Missing Integration Points**
   - API routes don't call version control
   - No middleware for automatic tracking
   - No connection to business logic

4. **Incomplete Coverage**
   - Only designed for MongoDB documents
   - Doesn't track related changes across collections
   - No tracking of derived calculations

5. **Operational Concerns**
   - No cleanup strategy for old versions
   - Could grow unbounded over time
   - No archival process

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Activate Current System (Recommended Short-term)

**Effort**: Low
**Benefits**: Infrastructure already exists

```javascript
// Add to all update operations
async function updateCampaign(id, changes, userId, reason) {
  await versionControl.trackChange('campaign', id, changes, userId, reason);
  // ... rest of update logic
}
```

### Option 2: Lightweight Audit Log

**Effort**: Medium
**Benefits**: Simpler, less storage

Instead of full snapshots, only track changes:

```javascript
{
  collection: 'campaigns',
  documentId: '123',
  changes: { budget: { old: 50000, new: 75000 } },
  user: 'user-456',
  timestamp: Date.now()
}
```

### Option 3: Time-Series Collections

**Effort**: High
**Benefits**: MongoDB-optimized for time data

Use MongoDB 5.0+ time-series collections:

```javascript
db.createCollection('campaign_history', {
  timeseries: {
    timeField: 'timestamp',
    metaField: 'campaignId',
    granularity: 'seconds',
  },
});
```

### Option 4: External Version Control Service

**Effort**: High
**Benefits**: Dedicated tooling, proven patterns

Options:

- **Temporal.io** - Workflow versioning
- **EventStore** - Purpose-built for event sourcing
- **Git-based** - Store JSON exports in Git

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (1-2 weeks)

1. **Activate existing versioning** on critical operations
2. **Add version fields** to campaign/strategy documents
3. **Create basic API endpoints** for version history
4. **Implement automatic tracking** in update operations

### Short-term (1-3 months)

1. **Build UI components** for version history
2. **Add rollback functionality** with approval workflow
3. **Implement cleanup strategy** for old versions
4. **Create comparison views** for version diffs

### Long-term Considerations

1. **Evaluate storage growth** and implement archival
2. **Consider time-series collections** for better performance
3. **Add cross-collection transaction tracking**
4. **Implement branching** for "what-if" scenarios

## Implementation Example

To activate versioning today:

```javascript
// 1. Add to campaign model
const campaignSchema = {
  ...existingFields,
  version: { type: String, default: 'v1.0.0' },
  lastModified: {
    by: String,
    at: Date,
    changeId: String,
  },
};

// 2. Wrap all updates
async function updateCampaignWithVersioning(id, updates, userId, reason) {
  const versionControl = new VersionControl(db);

  const changes = Object.entries(updates).map(([key, value]) => ({
    path: key,
    value,
  }));

  const result = await versionControl.trackChange('campaign', id, changes, userId, reason);

  return result;
}

// 3. Add API endpoint
app.get('/api/campaigns/:id/history', async (req, res) => {
  const history = await versionControl.getChangeHistory('campaign', req.params.id);
  res.json(history);
});
```

## Conclusion

The Media Tool has a **sophisticated but inactive** versioning system. The architecture is sound and could be activated with relatively little effort. However, it requires integration into the application layer and UI components to be useful. For a media planning tool where budgets, strategies, and allocations change frequently, having an active version control system would provide significant value for audit trails, mistake recovery, and change analysis.
