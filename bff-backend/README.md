# Backend for Frontend (BFF)

This directory is a placeholder for a potential Backend for Frontend (BFF) layer.

## What is a BFF?

A Backend for Frontend is a dedicated backend service that is tightly coupled to a specific frontend application. It acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the headless API, providing:

1. **Frontend-specific data transformations**
2. **Response aggregation from multiple API calls**
3. **Frontend-specific authentication/session management**
4. **Caching optimized for the frontend's needs**
5. **WebSocket connections for real-time features**

## Architecture Principles

If implemented, this BFF should:

- **NEVER bypass the headless API** - All data operations must go through the headless API
- **NEVER duplicate business logic** - Business rules remain in the headless API
- **Own frontend-specific concerns only** - UI state, view models, etc.
- **Can have its own storage** - For UI preferences, session data, cache

## When to Implement

Consider implementing a BFF when:

- The frontend needs complex data aggregation
- Real-time features are required (WebSockets)
- Frontend-specific caching is beneficial
- The headless API serves multiple different frontends
- Frontend team needs autonomy over their backend

## Example Structure

```
bff-backend/
├── src/
│   ├── aggregators/     # Combine multiple API calls
│   ├── transformers/    # Frontend-specific data shapes
│   ├── cache/          # Frontend-optimized caching
│   ├── websockets/     # Real-time connections
│   └── auth/           # Frontend session management
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Use TypeScript for type safety
2. Share types with frontend via workspace
3. Keep it thin - delegate to headless API
4. Document which headless API endpoints are used
5. Version in sync with frontend requirements

## Current Status

This is currently a placeholder. The frontend communicates directly with the headless API.
