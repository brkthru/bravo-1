# ETL Pipeline Summary

## Overview

Successfully created a comprehensive ETL pipeline with concise/verbose output options and improved error handling.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Logger Utility** (`utils/logger.ts`)

- Created a flexible logger with verbosity control
- Supports concise (default) and verbose modes
- Optional timestamps for operation tracking
- Summary vs detailed output based on mode

### 2. **Output Control Flags**

- `--verbose`: Shows detailed progress and debug information
- `--timestamps`: Adds elapsed time to each operation
- Default mode shows only essential information and errors

### 3. **Fixed Import Issues**

- Fixed `getDatabase` import errors in UserService and AccountService
- Fixed ETL route to use correct database import syntax
- Increased JSON payload limit from 10MB to 100MB

### 4. **Pipeline Status Reporting**

- Fixed success/failure status to accurately reflect errors
- Shows error count in final summary
- Properly tracks entities loaded vs failed

## Current ETL Results

### Successful Loads

- ✅ **Users**: 326 loaded (100% success)
- ✅ **Accounts**: 9,796 loaded (100% success)
- ✅ **Strategies**: 13,417 loaded (100% success)
- ✅ **Line Items**: 4,118 loaded (100% success)
- ✅ **Platform Buys**: 56,020 loaded (100% success)
- ✅ **Media Plans**: 13,417 loaded (100% success)

### Partial Success

- ⚠️ **Campaigns**: 13,282 of 13,417 loaded (99% success, 135 failures)

### Total Statistics

- **Total Records Processed**: 110,375
- **Successfully Loaded**: 110,240 (99.88% success rate)
- **Failed**: 135 (0.12% failure rate)
- **Processing Time**: ~53 seconds

## Known Issues

### 1. Campaign Import Failures (135 records)

- Error: "Campaign not found"
- Likely due to validation or upsert logic in CampaignService
- Affects ~1% of campaigns

### 2. Account Revenue Calculation

- Shows concatenated values instead of sum in verbose mode
- Cosmetic issue, doesn't affect data import

### 3. Large Payload Handling

- Platform buys (57MB) and campaigns (15MB) require increased limits
- Currently handled by 100MB limit
- Future improvement: implement batch processing

## Usage Examples

### Concise Mode (Default)

```bash
bun run-full-etl-pipeline.ts
```

### Verbose Mode

```bash
bun run-full-etl-pipeline.ts --verbose
```

### With Timestamps

```bash
bun run-full-etl-pipeline.ts --timestamps
```

### Transform Only

```bash
bun run-full-etl-pipeline.ts --transform-only
```

### Load Only

```bash
bun run-full-etl-pipeline.ts --load-only
```

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Campaign Failures**: Debug why 135 campaigns fail validation
2. **Implement Batch Processing**: For datasets > 10MB to avoid payload issues
3. **Fix Revenue Calculation**: Correct the account revenue sum calculation
4. **Add Progress Bars**: For better UX during long operations
5. **Implement Retry Logic**: For failed records
